        "*Disclaimer*: We calculated a 95% CI that is not quite right. There are some nuances that can make a difference especially for small samples (e.g., less than 30). We'll leave out this nuance as right now we are interested in getting the idea that you can quantify your uncertainty about your sample using confidence intervals. If you'd like to learn more chech out [the great chapter here](https://https://www.crumplab.com/statistics/probability-sampling-and-estimation.html#the-central-limit-theorem). Later we'll see how we can use a function call **confint** to help us calculate proper 95% confidence intervals!"
